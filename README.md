# First-NN-by-Detecting-Handwritten-Characters
The project is about detecting handwritten digits, based on the famous “MNIST database of handwritten digits” by Yann LeCun et al. 

## Introduction
The MNIST-Database is a large dataset of 70.000 handwritten digits that are mainly used for training several image processing systems, especially in the deeplearning field.

The dataset consists digits from 0 to 9 in a 28x28 pixel based format. The values are stored in a comma separted file in which each row has 785 values (28x28 = 784) where every row represents a different number that is initially displayed in the first value of the row (784 + 1).

If you are interested in the MNIST-Dataset more, you will find detailed information on Yann LeCun's website here. Next to the dataset explanation you will find a list of benchmarks for different classifiers and pre-processing approaches that were used with this dataset.

This work here is based on the very good explanation by Tariq Rashid about neural networks, so thank you for that great work.
